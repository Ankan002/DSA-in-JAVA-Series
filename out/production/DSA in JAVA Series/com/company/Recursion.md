What is Recursion?

Recursion is method of problem where a function calls itself. But the statement
given is quite loose. How can we perform recursion, this is the actual question
. So to answer this we need 3 steps:

1. Identifying the Recursive Case: Here the term or the expression is identified
   on which the recursive case is applied.

2. Identifying the base: The base case defines until where the recursive case 
   should run. 
   
3. Identifying the unintentional cases: In this step we generally indentify 
   the cases which is not taken under consideration while writing the program 
   but might cause error in the runtime.
   

All of the steps have been followed while solving the recursion problems.
